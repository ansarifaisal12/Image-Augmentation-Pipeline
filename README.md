# Image-Augmentation-Pipeline
This code uses the Augmentor library to perform data augmentation on a set of images located in a directory.
# Installation
You can install the Augmentor library using pip:
pip install Augmentor
Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Replace the directory path in the Pipeline function with the path to your own image directory.

Modify the augmentation parameters or add/remove techniques as necessary. Refer to the Augmentor documentation for more information on the available techniques and parameters.

Run the code. It will generate a set of augmented images based on the parameters you specified.

python
Copy code
import Augmentor

# Define the pipeline with the path to your image directory
p = Augmentor.Pipeline(r"C:/Users/photo")

# Add augmentation techniques with their respective parameters
p.zoom(probability=0.3, min_factor=0.8, max_factor=1.5)
p.flip_top_bottom(probability=0.4)
p.random_brightness(probability=0.3, min_factor=0.3, max_factor=1.2)
p.random_distortion(probability=1, grid_width=4, grid_height=4, magnitude=8)

# Add additional augmentation techniques to the pipeline
p.rotate(probability=0.5, max_left_rotation=10, max_right_rotation=10)
p.skew(probability=0.3, magnitude=0.2)
p.random_contrast(probability=0.5, min_factor=0.5, max_factor=1.5)
p.random_erasing(probability=0.3, rectangle_area=0.2)

# Generate 200 augmented images
p.sample(200)
